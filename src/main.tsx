              This was obviously a big mistake, and i shall never do it again.
              As i have deeply sinned to you our lord and saviour, i am writing
              this heartfelt deep apology, which is taking up 5 hours. I am
              writing this from the bottom of my deep big heart, and hopefully
              you will find some light in me to accept me into your forgiving
              and amazing arms, Mr.Scottish. I will never ever do this again, as
              I know the consequenses, and i will be more careful with how my
              words slip out of my shameless disgusting potty mouth.
